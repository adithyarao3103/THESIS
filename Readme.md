# Dissertation Report Template, SVNIT

The dissertation report template is written in simple latex, without creating horrendous classes or any stuff. 

To get started, open the THESIS.tex and edit the values of your title, name etc. The preamble, i.e. cover page, declaration, certificate, etc will be automatically generated for you. 

Further, you can add your acknowledgement and abstract to their respective .tex files.

Create your thesis chapters in the folder **Chapters** in the form of chapter#.tex, and set the \numChapters to the number of chapters, and the pdf will automatically compile with all the chapters.
